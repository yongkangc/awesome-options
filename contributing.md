### Help improve the Options Trading Reading List!

I would love for this project to turn into a community-driven resource. You can help by:

- Adding more book recommendations with detailed reviews
- Contributing new educational resources and courses
- Adding real-world trading examples and case studies
- Improving existing content with better descriptions
- Adding new categories or sections
- Correcting any errors or outdated information
- Anything else you think would help options traders learn more effectively

### There are a few ways you can contribute:

- Go to the [GitHub project page](https://github.com/yongkang/options) and make the edits yourself, then create a pull request. You can learn about creating a pull request [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
- Create a new issue with your suggestions. Create an issue [here](https://github.com/yongkang/options/issues)
- Fork the repository and submit improvements

### Content Guidelines

When contributing, please:

- Ensure all book recommendations include proper attribution and links
- Provide brief but informative descriptions
- Organize content by skill level (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- Include ratings or difficulty levels where appropriate
- Verify that links are working and current
